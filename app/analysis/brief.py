"""Today's Brief: the Command Center's stories as a text-only newsletter.

One section per tile, in the page's tile order, each holding the stories
that tile cycles through: a linked headline, its source, and one line from
the feed's own description. No images and no scripts, so it reads the same
in a browser, in print, and pasted into an email.

Built from build_engine_data()'s output, so the brief and the tiles cannot
disagree about which stories lead. Rendered from one template by the static
build (scripts/build_command_center_data.py -> public/brief.html) and by
Flask's /brief.
